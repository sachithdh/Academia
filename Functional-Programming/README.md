## Functional Programming


This repository contains coursework and examples from my Functional Programming course, focused on learning and applying key concepts using Scala. Topics include pure functions, higher-order functions, lambda functions, pattern matching, recursion, and more. Each module demonstrates how to leverage Scala's functional programming capabilities to write concise, expressive, and maintainable code.
